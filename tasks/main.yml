      A configuration file was set up automatically in /etc/ara/ara.cfg.
      The ARA service is already using this configuration file but you'll need to make sure Ansible is using it so that Ansible knows where ARA is located.

      This can be done by exporting the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable, like so:
      $ export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/etc/ara/ara.cfg
      $ ansible-playbook playbook.yml

      Data from recorded playbooks will be available in the interface as soon as you run your first ansible-playbook command.
